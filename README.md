## General info
Matlab codes for graphic simulation of a random fractal percolation on the 2D hexagonal lattice
The codes are developed and designed speciically for capstone project "Random Fractal Percolation on 2D Honeycomb Lattice".
  
## Content
This respository contains three matlab files: fractalhex.m, plotting_ex1.m, animation_ex1.m.
###fractalhex.m
The matlab function that generates an output array of x,y-coordinates of hexagons in the model.
###plotting_ex1.m
The matlab example file that generates multiple graphical plots of the model using function fractalhex().
###animation_ex1.m
The matlab example file that generates an animation video showing changes in time of the model.
Besides, there are two output files: simulation.avi, simulation.jpg.
###simulation.avi
Example output video by file "animation_ex1.m".
###simulation.jpg
Example output figure by file "plotting_ex1.m".

## Setup
The code is developed in MATLAB R2019b.
